# Decision-Tree-classifier
## Overview. 

Developed an Decision Tree classifier based on Gini Index, Entropy.  

Then identify the root node for the decision tree, based on the information gain computed.

use the `GolfDataset.csv` file provided.

The classification problem here is to predict 'play golf or not' using the attributes below.  

Next a comparison is made for the classification problem that to predict what type of forest it is based on spectral characteristics of using ASTER satellite imagery.

use files under `ForestTypes/` folder provided.
